# ZQuest Classic: 2.55 Development Summary
ZQuest Classic has grown by a ***huge*** amount between 2.50.2/2.53 and 2.55 versions. There are many new features, for gameplay, editing, ui, ease-of-use, scripting, and really every possible part of the engine you could imagine. Here, I'm going to go through each feature in some amount of depth to show what's new.

## Editor GUI
Previously, ZQ had 'Small Mode' and 'Large Mode'. This divide could no longer be feasibly supported, mainly because small mode's base resolution was simply too small to fit the GUI for many of the new features, requiring us to make entirely separate GUIs for small mode, which was simply too much work to keep up. However, numerous users took issue with this from an accessibility standpoint, as the large mode GUI had a lot of spots where text was too small to read for some, among other issues. As such, BOTH of these modes have recieved a giant overhaul, to create a brand new and more customizable GUI.

Pictured above on the left is compact mode, and on the right is expanded mode. The `< Expand` / `> Compact` button in the top bar toggles between these modes. Since both modes use the *exact same window size*, many things can be easily supported between them, including switching without the need to relaunch the entire program. Additionally, there are several other minor toggles that you can use in the GUI.

* The `<|>` / `>|<` button above the combo columns allows you to toggle how many columns show. This toggles between 1/2 in compact, and 2/4 in expanded. Obviously, less columns means they have room to display larger, making them easier to read- while more columns gives you more combos usable at once.
* The `+` / `-` button near the `Favorites` functions similarly, allowing more to be shown at once at the cost of being smaller, or vice-versa.
* The `<` / `>` buttons near the `Favorites` allow you to change *pages*, because there are now multiple pages of favorites. Right-clicking these buttons allows you to jump straight to a specific page.
* The `+` / `-` button near the `Favorite Commands`... also functions similarly, allowing more or less commands to show. Some of the text may be cut off (abbreviated with `...`) if it cannot fit, which is more of a problem when showing more commands- though hovering over a command with tooltips enabled will display a tooltip of the full text.
* The `X` buttons near the `Favorites` and `Favorite Commands` respectively, clear all favorites/favorite commands (with an `Are you sure?` popup to prevent accidental deletion)
* The `SWP` button, *only available in Compact mode*, changes the bottom pane to work more similarly to the old small-mode pane, only displaying one set of: `4 warp return squares`, `item + stairs + green square + flags`, or `screen's enemies` at a time, with up/down arrows to cycle between these 3 panels. (This allows the text here to be larger and more readable, if you find it too small to read otherwise).
* By right-clicking on the minimap, you can *zoom in* on it, making it much larger. While it is zoomed, any click that is not on the minimap will un-zoom, as will pressing `Esc`, or right-clicking again.<br/><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1162478250208022679/1162493082009354270/compact_zoomed_minimap.png?ex=653c230c&is=6529ae0c&hm=d19a72b31cc44ebad7bc1935c7165f28e8fbfd4d6168648d18e3b297cdb2b12b&" alt="Screenshot of the editor, with the minmap zoomed in, in compact mode." width="50%" height="50%"></img>
* In `Etc->Options`, you can change what fonts are used by various portions of the program. The default font is larger than it used to be, to improve readability. NOTE: Some older dialog windows will have overlapping text as a result of this, such sections need to be upgraded eventually to be able to handle variable font size, but just haven't been gotten to yet.

## Drawing Modes
Previously, you had to cycle through drawing modes one-by-one using the draw mode button in the upper-right. But now, you can simply right-click on the draw mode button to pop up a selector menu.<br/><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1162478250208022679/1162494416603324607/drawmode_rclick.png?ex=653c244b&is=6529af4b&hm=0c0a7342131077782882af566b63ca5f577e7ff00f83c7dcf22f6744559b5a37&" alt="Screenshot of the drawing mode dropdown" width="50%" height="50%"></img>

Additionally, you may notice that the available drawing modes have changed.
* Normal drawing mode, for placing combos just as normal.
* Alias drawing mode is mostly unchanged.
* Pool drawing mode is entirely new; combo pools are weighted collections of combos, and when drawn on the screen, a random combo is selected from the pool for each position. This is useful for randomized decorations, like cracked/mossy/etc floor tiles, or variety in flowers/grass. Actions like floodfill (`Ctrl+Click`) work as expected, filling each position with a separately randomized combo. Undo/Redo do not re-randomize, though placing the pool again obviously will.<br/><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1162478250208022679/1162496106056388799/combopool.png?ex=653c25dd&is=6529b0dd&hm=f63e8fa647180c16b8db5e3f07c7fc4c57ee16a55fd793a569e83466220189be&" alt="Screenshot of the combo pool editor" width="50%" height="50%"></img>
* Auto Combo drawing mode has some brand-new features, as well as everything the old `Relational` and `Dungeon Carving` modes had, merged into one mode. This allows you to set up specificly-laid-out sets of combos, and chooses which combos to place smartly based on the surrounding combos on the screen. This can be used to automatically draw entire mountains, lakes, etc, automatically handling the edges/corners for you as you draw.<br/><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1162478250208022679/1162497044045365340/autocombo.png?ex=653c26bd&is=6529b1bd&hm=d7dfbdacc62ca22758c20d592f858c965500565b8fa0fa9f45fe4ff0f62fa7b2&" alt="Screenshot of the auto combo editor" width="50%" height="50%"></img>
